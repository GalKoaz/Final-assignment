<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Introduction to Data Science Final Project 2020

In this project we will use all the tools we learned during the course on machine learning, in the first stage we will deal with the ability to solve probability exercises, in the second stage we will focus on our internalization and realization of tools learned for pandas, numpy and visualization, in the last part we will focus on machine learning.
Which includes classification and regression, ie the ability to take a data set and analyze it to predict exact values and use appropriate models for this.

"The world is just a one Big Data problem üòÑ"

---------

### First part: Probability

Within this part we were asked to solve probable questions.
Some of which were solved with the help of Bayes' theorem, random variables,  inference and understanding from graphs.

---------

### Second part: Programming

In this section we were asked to answer a number of questions that indicate the ability to understand and internalize what is learned throughout the course related to pandas, numpy etc...

---------

### Third part: Machine Learning

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
